## [N-01] Lack of address(0) checks in the constructor

Zero-address check should be used in the constructors, to avoid the risk of setting smth as address(0) at deploying time.

## [N-02] Assembly Codes Specific â€“ Should Have Comments

Since this is a low level language that is more difficult to parse by readers, include extensive documentation, comments on the rationale behind its use, clearly explaining what each assembly instruction does.

This will make it easier for users to trust the code, for reviewers to validate the code, and for developers to build on or update the code.

Note that using Assembly removes several important security features of Solidity, which can make the code more insecure and more error-prone.
